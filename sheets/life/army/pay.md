Pay and Allowances
===============================================================================

> BLUF on pay, if you submit it, and they say they processed it, they should be able to provide what's called a TL (stands for Transmission Letter). If they can't give you one, it didn't go to DFAS. Once it goes to DFAS, there's a timeline for it to hit your account (usually about a week), but you should be confident it's there.

The document responsible for one of the biggest sources of difficulty in the Reserves (Getting paid) is **USAR Pam 37-1, Defense Joint Military Pay System - Reserve Component (DJMS-RC) Procedures Manual**, dated 7 May 2018.
